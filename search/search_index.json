The user should have the necessary privileges and access rights to connect to the Apache Ignite data store of choice. How to use Using the extension in WSO2 Stream Processor You can use this extension in the latest WSO2 Stream Processor that is a part of WSO2 Analytics offering, with editor, debugger and simulation support. This extension is shipped by default with WSO2 Stream Processor, if you wish to use an alternative version of this extension you can replace the component jar that can be found in the <STREAM_PROCESSOR_HOME>/lib directory. Using the extension as a java library This extension can be added as a maven dependency along with other Siddhi dependencies to your project. <dependency> <groupId>org.wso2.extension.siddhi.store.</groupId> <artifactId>siddhi-store-ignite</artifactId> <version>x.x.x</version> </dependency> How to Contribute Please report issues at GitHub Issue Tracker . Send your contributions as pull requests to master branch . Contact us Post your questions with the \"Siddhi\" tag in Stackoverflow . Siddhi developers can be contacted via the mailing lists: Developers List : dev@wso2.org Architecture List : architecture@wso2.org Support We are committed to ensuring support for this extension in production. Our unique approach ensures that all support leverages our open development methodology and is provided by the very same engineers who build the technology.
